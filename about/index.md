### Me

My name is Luca Fabri. I am 24 y.o. student from Senigallia. I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering and I'm currently following the first year of the Master's.
I love binary exploitation, I am currently approaching to kernel challenges and adversarial machine learning.
I am also interested in machine learning applications in computer security.
