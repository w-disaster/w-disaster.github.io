    <description><![CDATA[These are notes I took while listening to Terence Tao's lecture on YouTube titled Structure and randomness in prime numbers. Most of the topics were taken and paraphrased from his slides, but I added some of his additional comments he made during the lecture.
There are many other sources where these topics are treated more clearly; however, this post is intended to help me memorize the material. I'm very excited by the fact that these materials are freely available on the web, and I believe they are one of the main reasons why the internet should exist.]]></description>
